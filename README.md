This directory adds iEL-SCF functionality to Tinker.

iEL-SCF is a hybrid extended-Lagrangian/self-consistent field scheme originally developed by Anders Niklasson and colleauges to solve for the ground state density matrix in AIMD simulations.  iEL-SCF is the extension of this method to the solution of mutually induced dipoles.  'i' denotes 'interially-restrained', a way to limit the interia of the kinetic modes of the 'EL' part of iEL-SCF, which is necessary to maintain stability.  Several methods are possible for this, each taking the form of a familiar temperature control scheme from typical MD simulations.  

More details will be forthcoming.
