                    Files for OpenMM-Enabled Tinker DYNAMIC
                    #######################################

         This directory contains the files needed to build a Tinker
         DYNAMIC program using the GPU-capable OpenMM libraries. The
         files in this directory should be copied into the /source
         directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and the program
         can be compiled and linked in that modified /source directory.

         Building an OpenMM-enabled DYNAMIC requires a special version
         of OpenMM, call OpenMM-Tinker that is available in a separate
         GitHub branch, currently https://github.com/pren/tinker-openmm
         This version contains changes to the canonical Stanford OpenMM
         that are needed for the Tinker interface, beyond implementation
         of the basic AMOEBA force field.

         The provided Makefile can then be used, after minor editing, to
         build a dynamic_omm.x executable. Either the GNU compilers or
         the Intel compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM
         is found in its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA
         CUDA V7.5 or later must be installed on the target machine, as
         well as a CUDA-capable graphics card.
